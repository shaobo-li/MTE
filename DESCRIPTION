Description: Several robust estimators for linear regression and variable selection are provided. 
              Included are Maximum tangent likelihood estimator (Qin, et al., 2017), 
              least absolute deviance estimator and Huber regression. The penalized version of each of these 
              estimator incorporates L1 penalty function, i.e., LASSO and Adaptive Lasso. They are able to 
              produce consistent estimates for both fixed and high-dimensional settings.
